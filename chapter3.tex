\caption{The $E_0$ page of the Mayer Vietoris Double Complex. The term $E^0_{i,j}$ is the vector space generated by the $i$-dimensional cells in a $j$-fold intersection. Horizontal maps correspond to taking the nerve boundary, vertical maps correspond to the boundary of the base complex. The cells of dimension $p$ in the blowup complex are found on the anti-diagonal defined by $i+j = p$.}

In this chapter we provide an exposition of the Mayer Vietoris Spectral Sequence. Recall, that a spectral sequence is a sequence of chain complexes $(E^r, d_r)$ called pages, where the terms of $E^{r+1}$ is composed of the homology on the previous page. This is an example of a spectral sequence of a double complex. In the context of a double complex, we have more algebraic data on each page. In particular, If we have a simplicial complex $\K$ with cover $\C$, then we have $E^r = \bigoplus_{p,q} E^r_{p,q}$ where $E^0_{p,q}$ is the vector space generated by cells of the form $\sigma \otimes \tau$ where $\sigma \in \K$ and $\tau \in N(\C)$ and $\dim{\sigma} = p$ and $\dim{\tau} = q$. Before we define the spectral sequence, observe that we have three different filtrations of vector spaces which we may construct from this data: $\tilde{E}_k = \bigoplus_{p+q=k} E^0_{p,q} \cong \C_k(\K^\C)$. There is a filtration of vector spaces $\bigoplus_{p+q \leq k} E^0_{p,q}$ which is the filtration of the blowup by total dimension, There is also the filtration: $\bigoplus_{p, q \leq k} E^0_{p,q}$ which is the filtration on the blowup complex by the nerve, used in the previous chapter. The filtration $\bigoplus_{p \leq k, q} E^0_{p,q}$, which filters the blowup complex by base complex dimension, which is related to the work in the next chapter.

We may define a differential $d_0: E^0_{p,q} \rightarrow E^0_{p-1,q}$ given by $d_0: \sigma \otimes \tau \rightarrow \partial_\K(\sigma) \otimes \tau$, making $(E^0, d_0)$ the first iterate in our spectral sequence. As usual, the homology of the $d_0$ differential provides the terms of the $E^1$ page. Unsurprisingly, the next differential, $d_1$ will be defined similarly, in terms of the right factor and $\partial_N$, the boundary on the nerve of the cover. This provides us with the $E^2$ page of the spectral sequence. The $d_2$ differential is defined as follows
