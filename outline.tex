\begin{itemize}
\item Parallel Algorithms for persistence are important. To a mathematician this means spectral sequences.
\item Two spectral sequences are immediately of interest, the spectral sequence of a filtration, and the mayer vietoris spectral sequence.  We explore both.
\item In the case of a filtration, studying it and deriving an algorithm is straightforward. We show how one may derive standard numerical optimizations from this.
\item In the case of M.V. deriving an algorithm is not so clear. It is not always possible for a mayer vietoris spectral sequence to converge to P.H. This is an extension problem.
\item To simplify the discussion of the mayer vietoris spectral sequence, we instead study a related topological space the mayer vietoris blowup complex. In this way we may resolve the extension problem. 
\item We first present results for this in the context of ordinary homology. We show that this algorithm is competitive. 
\item Doing this naively results in increased computational complexity. By changing basis the problem is simpler. (Theorem)
\item The implementation of these approaches still don't make these algorithms compelling, even for nice enough cubical spaces.
\item Move back to reductions on the original input space, perhaps makes the problem easier(?)
